## norec_fine_tools

In this repository I present code from my thesis work with Targeted Sentiment Analysis for Norwegian. An important part of the work is to process and understand [the NoReC-fine dataset](https://github.com/ltgoslo/norec_fine). 

My versions of the NoReC-fine data are not meant to be authoritative. I have made som choices when converting from json to conll. These may not correspond with what you think is reasonable, or with the choices in the conversion script in the NoReC-fine repo.

The resources I publish here are accompanied by the Norwegian blog at [egilron.github.io/](https://egilron.github.io/).
